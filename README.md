# COMP250_Project

## Project Description 

This project is a bot for the microRTS game, it uses minimax to decide on the best action to take. The bot is able to play against itself and against other bots.


## How to run the bot

All the instructions for setting this bot up are on the micro RTS website: [microRTS website](https://sites.google.com/site/micrortsaicompetition/getting-started?authuser=0)

Following through these tutorials it will show you how to set up the IDE and then get the bot running. The only problem is that this is all of the documentation and if you have any problems there is not really anybody to get into contact with. 

## Why

This bot was created for the COMP250 module of the second year of my degree, the module was focused around AI and I chose to make a bot for the MicroRTS game.
